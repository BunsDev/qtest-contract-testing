# Welcome to EOS Helper 

EOS Helper is a Javascript-based [EOS](https://eosnetwork.com/) smart-contract testing framework, created by [Genereos](https://genereos.io).

EOS Helper gives you the ability to dockerize an EOSIO node that can run on any system. This allows the ability for the user to host it on their system easily and automated with the ability to test for multiple EOSIO based chains i.e. EOS, WAX, TELOS, PROTON, FIO and UX. It also allows for each project to simply set up CI/CD and seed table data without modifying contracts. 

## Main features

- #### Ability to init/reset table data
- #### Ability to test accounts and permissions
- #### Built with Javascript
- #### Dockerize an EOSIO node that can be run on the users system automatically
- #### Ability to test multiple EOSIO(EOS/WAX/TELOS) networks with links to public snapshots.
- #### Simplified method to setup CI/CD
